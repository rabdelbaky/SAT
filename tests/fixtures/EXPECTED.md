# tests/fixtures/EXPECTED.md

Discovery expectations for the `monorepo` fixture.
Each entry is what `discover_projects` must return for that fixture folder.

## monorepo

**Fixture layout** (paths relative to `tests/fixtures/monorepo/`):

```
package.json                          ← root JS project
index.ts
packages/
  api/
    package.json                      ← sub-project JS
    index.ts
  ui/
    package.json                      ← sub-project JS
    Button.tsx
services/
  worker/
    go.mod                            ← Go sub-project
    main.go
  ml/
    pyproject.toml                    ← Python sub-project (priority winner)
    requirements.txt                  ← Python build file (lower priority, kept in build_files)
    train.py
node_modules/
  lodash/
    package.json                      ← SKIPPED (node_modules is a skip folder)
build/
  classes/
    pyproject.toml                    ← SKIPPED (build is a skip folder)
.git/
  HEAD                                ← SKIPPED (.git is a skip folder)
dist/                                 ← SKIPPED (dist is a skip folder)
```

**Expected projects** (4 total, ordered by path):

| Path (relative to fixture root) | Language   | Primary build file   | All build_files                           | tested   |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| `.`                             | javascript | `package.json`       | `["package.json"]`                        | false    |
| `packages/api`                  | javascript | `package.json`       | `["package.json"]`                        | false    |
| `packages/ui`                   | javascript | `package.json`       | `["package.json"]`                        | false    |
| `services/ml`                   | python     | `pyproject.toml`     | `["pyproject.toml", "requirements.txt"]`  | false    |
| `services/worker`               | go         | `go.mod`             | `["go.mod"]`                              | false    |

**Total: 5 projects**

**Skipped folders** (no projects found inside them):
- `node_modules/` — skip rule
- `build/` — skip rule
- `.git/` — skip rule
- `dist/` — empty

**Priority check** (`services/ml`):
- Both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` exist.
- `pyproject.toml` wins (first in `build_priority` for python).
- Both filenames appear in `build_files`.
- Only **one** Python project is reported for `services/ml` (not two).

**File ownership** (nearest build file wins):
- `index.ts` at root belongs to `.` (javascript), not to any sub-package.
- `packages/api/index.ts` belongs to `packages/api` (javascript).
- `packages/ui/Button.tsx` belongs to `packages/ui` (javascript).
- `services/worker/main.go` belongs to `services/worker` (go).
- `services/ml/train.py` belongs to `services/ml` (python).

**--dry-run output** (one line per project, format: `<path>  <language>  <build_files>  [untested]`):

```
.  javascript  package.json  [untested]
packages/api  javascript  package.json  [untested]
packages/ui  javascript  package.json  [untested]
services/ml  python  pyproject.toml, requirements.txt  [untested]
services/worker  go  go.mod  [untested]
```

*(All languages are `[untested]` until fixtures pass; exact whitespace may vary.)*

**No-project exit code**: running the tool against an empty folder must exit 3
and print `No supported projects found.` to stderr.
